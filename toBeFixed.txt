1 - user class uses admin as superclass and this causes users to access admin methods they shouldn't (viewAllUsersInfo etc) .
2 - admin class doesn't have the methods even the user has(closeAccount,resetPassword,createAccount etc)
3 - some classes has unused and unnecessery variables and methods( for example  user class balance variable and getter setter methods of it)
4 - users are able to withdraw negative money which doesn't make any  sense .
